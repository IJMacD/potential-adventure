Lesson 0: Introduction
======================

This lesson isn't really a lesson; we're just going to tell you a few things
about the site and what you're going to need.

Prerequisites
-------------

There aren't really any prerequisites. The intention of this guide is to take
you from absolute beginner and show you everything you need to know to write
great websites now.

Software
--------

Software you will require: basically nothing special.

Software that will greatly help:

 * A decent browser - right now that means [Chrome][].
   - It updates automatically and frequently.
   - Support for new features and APIs are added all the time.
   - Its fast
   - Developer Tools in Chrome is fantastic and will make your life so much
     easier.
   You must still test in other browsers but developing with Chrome is quick
   and easy.
 * A decent text editor - you _can_ work in Notepad - but that would make life
   very difficult for yourself. You need a text editor with decent syntax
   highlighting and features designed for developing like auto-indentation and
   commment shortcuts. I suggest one of the following:
   - [Sublime Text][] - Simple, clutter free interface with loads of handy
     features.
   - [Notepad++][notepadpp] - Free and also very powerful.

[chrome]: <www.google.com/chrome> "Google Chrome"
[sublime text]: <http://www.sublimetext.com/> "Sublime text editor"
[notepadpp]: <http://notepad-plus-plus.org/> "Notepad++"

        as well as any other developers who may look at your code.</p>
